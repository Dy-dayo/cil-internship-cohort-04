The assignment is in my [Figma Page](https://www.figma.com/file/FjoWL4PY1X6820hFrUIoA4/7th-Assignment-My-findings-on-UX)

UX :  This stands for Users Experience . It is a term used to describe the overall experience  a user has when interacting with a product or service. User’s experience with  a given product can be delightful or awful. UX is not limited to software products. User experience can deal with how user (consumers)  make use of anything and their experience while using it. Hence, User Experience Designer is a designer who has the comfortability of a user in mind when designing a product of service. From research, we can say the question a UX designer aims to answer is “how can we make this product easy to use for users” . They look at the ease, quality and efficiency of product. That is, making a product user friendly. A product with good UX will be useful, usable, desireble, findable, accessible, and credible. 

The term UX  was coined by Dr Donald Norman. An electrical engineer and cognitive scientist who worked at Apple. He coined the term in the 1990s. In Norman’s words, UX is meant to emcompass “all aspects of a person’s experience with a system, from the materials used to the interaction itself(physical or digital), along with the interface, graphics, and orientation.”



## An Article on UI/UX fundamentals

 An ordinary person has come to believe the UI and UX are terms used to describe the same thing because of how often they hear them. It is wrongfully believed that when you are talking of UI, you are talking of UX and vice versa. Since you are reading this article, you are lucky. By the time you finish reading it, you will know the difference between UI and UX. While they aree relatable terms, they are also distinct. Let us start with you UI.

 UI is a term that stands for Users Interface design. It is the graphical design interface which users interact with. it is the look, the presentation and the interactivity of a product, UI is the point of interaction between the user and a digital device like your mobile phones, slide presentation, the way apps appear etc. In relation to websites and apps, it is about making sure that the user interface of a product is as intuitive as possible. That is carefully considering each and every visual interactive element the user might encounter. People who are into this craft are also known as User Interface designers. User interface design considers all the visual interactive element of a product  interface  including the buttons, icons, spacing, colour scheme, and responsive design. UI designs transfer the brand's strength and visual assets to a product's interface. Making sure the designis consistent, coherent and aesthetically pleasing. Their work is mainly digital.

 On the other hand, This stands for Users Experience . It is a term used to describe the overall experience  a user has when interacting with a product or service. User’s experience with a given product can be delightful or awful. UX is not limited to software products. User experience can deal with how user (consumers)  make use of anything and their experience while using it. Hence, User Experience Designer is a designer who has the comfortability of a user in mind when designing a product of service. From research, we can say the question a UX designer aims to answer is “how can we make this product easy to use for users” . They look at the ease, quality and efficiency of product.

The term UX  was coined by Dr Donald Norman. An electrical engineer and cognitive scientist who worked at Apple. He coined the term in the 1990s. In Norman’s words, UX is meant to emcompass “all aspects of a person’s experience with a system, from the materials used to the interaction itself(physical or digital), along with the interface, graphics, and orientation.”  Essentially, UX applies to anything that can be experienced. Be it a website, a visit to a supermarket, a blender. The "user experience" part refers to the interaction between the user and a product or service.  User experience design then considers all the different elements that shape this experience. 


#### Differences between UI and UX
* UI focuses on the visual point that allows a user to interract with a product while UX focuses on the user's full experience from the first contact to the last.

* UI designer want to build product that delight the users aesthetically while UX designers want to build product that delight users with their effectiveness. 

* UI applies to only digital product while UX applies to any product(making users experience better). 

* UI is more of aesthetic approach to product designing while UX is more of human-first approach.

With all their differences and similarities, they both work hand-in-hand to make a good product or software for user. Most people that learn UI also go on to learn UX. To avoid making product with "good UI but bad UX". Both are also aspect of the product design field.
