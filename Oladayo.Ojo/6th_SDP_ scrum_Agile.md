# Scrum and its benefits
Scrum is an agile methodology. This is a methodology where different part aspect of software development are divided into smaller chunks. This is to help the production team to focus on process and concrete deliverable. It is also to make sure that the team does not waste any productive time.

It is a methodology that involves the project/ product owner in each phase of development. In scrum you split your organization into small cross-functional, self-organizing teams. Work is also divided into a list of small, concrete deliverables. It consist of iterations called sprints each sprint is between 2-4 weeks and it is preceded by planning.

A product owner makes a prioritized wish list known as a product backlog.

The scrum team takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called a sprint backlog and plans to implement it.
    
The team completes their sprint backlog task in a sprint (a 2-4 week period). They assess progress in a meeting called a daily scrum.

The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.

At the sprintâ€™s end, the work is ready to ship or show. The team closes the sprint with a review, then starts a new sprint.
